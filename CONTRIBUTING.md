## Questions

If you have any support questions, please open a [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/yukinagae/genkit-go-plugins/discussions). The GitHub issue tracker is not for support-related requests.

## Feature Requests

Major Changes that you wish to contribute to the project should be discussed first in an GitHub issue that clearly outlines the changes and benefits of the feature.

Small Changes can directly be crafted and submitted to the GitHub Repository as a Pull Request.

## Reporting Bugs

**If you discover a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email yuki.nagae1130@gmail.com instead.**

Before you submit your issue, please [search the issue archive](https://github.com/yukinagae/genkit-go-plugins/issues) - your issue might have already been identified or addressed.

If you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by submitting an issue or, even better, you can submit a Pull Request with a fix.

## Contributing with code

Working on your first open source project or pull request? Here are some helpful tutorials:

### Getting Started

#### Local install

If you want to develop locally, please make sure to have Node >=22 installed on you machine.

You can set up the local development environment as follows:

1. Run `npm run install` from the root directory of the project.
2. You are good to go!

### Finding an Issue

The list of open feature requests and bugs can be found on our on our [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/yukinagae/genkit-go-plugins/issues). Pick an unassigned issue that you think you can accomplish and add a comment that you are attempting to do it.

### Development Process

If you are a first time contributor, we highly suggest to read the GitHub fork and pull-request process [here](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962).

We work directly in the `main` branch. In order to contribute to the project you can create a new branch starting from there.

When you are done, make sure to create a Pull Request with `main` as the base branch.

### Building the Project

You can build the package with npm from the root directory:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Testing

If you add code you need to add tests! If your pull request reduces our test coverage because it lacks tests then it will be rejected.

Tests can be added in the `tests` subfolder of each of the plugins. As an example, please take a look at the tests which are already there.

You can then run tests with npm from the root directory:

```bash
npm run test
```
